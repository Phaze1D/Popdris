# Popdris
[Popdris](https://phaze1d.github.io/Popdris/) is a HTML canvas game that run on [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) game engine. It is a mix between Candy Crush and Tetris. The user swipes on a bubble to move it up down left or right and has to combine 3 or more bubbles of the same color to be able to pop them. The more bubbles the user combines the more points they get. The game is a single infinite level game that only ends once the a bubble reaches the top of the game area. **The game starts of very easily but will become harder and harder the longer you last**
